# sentiment-analysis
This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using Python to classify the sentiment of textual data. It involves preprocessing data, feature extraction using techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings, and training machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or deep learning methods. The project can be applied to various datasets such as product reviews, social media comments, or tweets.

Key features:

Data preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral)
Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
Visualization of sentiment distribution

Tools and libraries used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Scikit-learn
NLTK / SpaCy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
